This is my final group project game for my Game Development core course at DIS in Copenhagen.  The group included Irene Kuo (Cornell University '16) and John Fisher (Binghamton University '16) and myself.  We were inspired by Call of Duty: Zombies.

This is the completed game.  The "project settings" and "assets" files will open in unity and build all the other stuff that is specific to each computer.  To play the already built game, use one of the following two links:

'P' is pause, 'R' is reset, and 'Esc' is to quit to desktop.
